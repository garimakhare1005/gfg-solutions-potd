        "Geek's resolutions often fades over time. Realistically, he can only commit to active participation for N (where N â‰¤ 366) days. Given the value of N and number of coins associated with each POTD, can Geek strategically solve some (or all) POTDs to become eligible for redeeming merchandise?\n",
